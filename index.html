                <p>One of the greatest experience anyone can have is traveling. It is the fastest way to
                    immerse yourself
                    into rich cultures, beautiful places and people. It is truly an eye opener that can change the way
                    life
                    is lived. The world is vast with a lot to offer with a ton of hidden gems that shouldn’t be missed
                    out!
                    It can sound daunting and like a lot of work is required to prepare but it doesn’t have to be.
                    Knowing
                    the essentials of how to get started can send you straight into an adventure of a lifetime!</p>

                <p>The first essential and prize possession while traveling is your passport. Apply for a
                    passport well in
                    advance to avoid any stress about when it will arrive as it is the key to your departure. Next make
                    digital copies as they can come in handy as you never want to risk your passport getting lost or
                    pickpocketed abroad without any documentations. The passport is not only used for flying but many
                    hotels
                    abroad will require scanning your passport upon arrival. It is quite common and nothing to be
                    worried
                    about. </p>

                <p>Next, research your destination. Decide upon a place you want to go to and see if it is
                    of interest to
                    you. Once a destination has been decided upon, before booking tickets look into whether you need a
                    visa
                    for that destination. For U.S passport holders, most of the UK, Europe and Asian countries do not
                    require a visa or have visas upon arrival but it is best to make sure what the situation is before
                    showing up as you will be denied entry if a visa is required. It is also important to check if any
                    vaccinations are required. </p>
                <p> Lastly, plan out your budget for the trip. Make sure you are spending on
                    things you want to do and allotting money towards expenses you know you want to place on. Traveling
                    there’s many options, compare accommodations and hotels. Cost can add up but having a plan can help.
                    Most countries have ride sharing apps and local apps for transportation that can lower cost. Finding
                    hotels nears local transportation such as buses and trains can make it easy to create routes to find
                    the
                    cheapest and fastest way to your destination. Also plan your itinerary, if you are traveling from
                    one
                    country to another, it is important to plan how long you are traveling, where you are going, how
                    you’ll
                    be going there.
                    Lastly, GO. Book the flight, and enjoy!
