                <h3>
                    Jordan
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Jordan has been a meeting place of different cultures throughout its history. From an ancient
                    Arabian
                    city, Roman ruins to ancient Judaic sites, Jordan has seen many civilizations come and go. One of
                    the
                    most awe striking views are the ancient city of Petra also known as the rose city due to the rose
                    color
                    sandstone. It involves a lot of walking to reach the treasury however it is worth it. Along the way
                    you
                    can see other structures such a tombs and caves that were lived in and their water way systems.
                    There
                    are plenty of places to take pictures from on top of caves and of carved structures that are still
                    preserved. However, they do have the option to ride a horse on the way back after all that walking.
                    Similarly Wadi Rum is like a scene out of Star Wars. It has an out of world feel to its atmosphere
                    and
                    view and one for a bucket list. Another must see destination is phenomenon of the Dead Sea. It is
                    below
                    sea level and a salt lake. No fish or animal can survive in it however you can float even if you
                    can’t
                    swim. The clay is amazing for your skin which you can just dip in and rub to relax in before washing
                    it
                    off revealing smooth skin. A recommendation is catching a sunset at the Dead Sea, the view is
                    amazing!
                    One of the best times to travel is around September- November as the weather is perfect. Jordan is
                    one
                    of those expensive countries however it is a destination to see.
